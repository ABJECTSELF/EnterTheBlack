### A not yet complete singleplayer:
- You can explore 1 system
- Dynamic zooming in on the nearest planet
- Ability to land on a planet and collect resources
- A planets surface is automatically generated by perlin noise
- You can leave and enter systems by travelling through hyperspace
- You can open a star map with 'm'
- You might meet alien fleets which(at the moment) automatically engage in combat.
### A Menu:
- You can change which keys you need to press to fire/turn/thrust in Settings.
- You can select which ship the players will get in the multiplayer mode.
## How to compile/run the game:
You don't need to download any libraries(isn't that great?)!

You can compile it however you want. I personally use eclipse to do that, but the project should be compatible with other ways to compile it.

To run it you can either use your IDE or execute the main class(Main.java).
## Contributing:
This project will take a long time to complete if I work on it all by myself. I appreciate any help I can get.

If you want to help make sure to read the [contributing guideline](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

I would really appreciate some storylines or similar.

The other graphics were made by me.

I also wrote all the code, but that may change.
