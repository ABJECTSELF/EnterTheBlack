# EnterTheBlack
A 2d space game where you can explore the galaxy and where you can make friends or enemies with other species. This game is currently WIP, but that's the goal.

## Features of the game:
### A working offline multiplayer:
- 2 people can fight each other in different space ships.
- 6 Different ships
- 1-2 different weapons per ship
- Weapons with automatic guiding system
### A not yet complete singleplayer:
- You can explore 1 system
- Dynamic zooming in on the nearest planet
- Ability to land on a planet and collect resources
- A planets surface is automatically generated by perlin noise
### Settings:
- You can change which keys you need to press to fire/turn/thrust.
## How to compile/run the game:
You don't need to download any libraries(isn't that great?)!
You can compile it however you want. I personally use eclipse to do that, but the project should be compatible with other ways to compile it.
## Help me:
This project will take a long time to complete if I work on it all by myself. I appreciate any help I can get. If you want to help you can always make a PR. If you are unsure you can first make an Issue describing the feature you would like to add.
## Credits:
All ship graphics were made by Joshua Wenzel.

The other graphics were made by me.

I also wrote all the code, but that may change.
