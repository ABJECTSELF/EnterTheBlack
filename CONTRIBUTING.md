### Bug Report
When you find a bug please report it, but when you do try to follow these points:
* Make sure that bug is not already reported in [issues](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/issues) or on the list [here](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/projects/2).
* If the bug is in the column "Cause unknown" and you know the cause you should write an issue anyway.
* Report bugs either in [issues](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/issues) or directly to me.
* Try to give me as much information on the bug as possible(Like a list of exceptions or details on how to reproduce the bug).
* Don't put multiple bugs within one issue. That will make handling issues rather hard.

### Feature Requests
I would be grateful for new ideas. Feature Requests(unless you implemented them) should be posted as [issues](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/issues).
Before you post a new feature request, ask yourself the following questions:
* Is this idea similar to other feature requests(if yes go to said request and start a discussion in the comments rather than creating a new issue)?
* Is this idea already on the [planned additions list](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/projects/1)?
* Will this idea make the game more interesting?
* Is it possible to implement this idea with reasonable effort?

### Pull Requests
If you are posting a [pull request](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/pulls):
* Do not put multiple unrelated changes into one pull request.
* Make sure the pull request does not contain unintended changes.
* Link any issues that are relevant for the pull request.
* Give a description of what you are actually doing and add comments to the code.
* Try to match the coding style of the rest of the project.
* Make sure you code compiles and runs without visible problems.

### You want to contribute, but don't know how?
There are many things that need to be done. You can find these on one of the following locations:
* In the [issues page](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/issues).
* On the [Planned additions list](https://github.com/IntegratedQuantum/EnterTheBlack/projects/1).
* In code comments starting with "TODO".
If you plan to solve one of these make sure there isn't already a pull request doing just that.
If you want to "claim" a feature  for implementation, you might want to create a pull request before actually implementing the feature.
